# Introduction

**INSPullToRefresh** was written by **[Micha≈Ç Zaborowski](https://github.com/m1entus)** for **[inspace.io](http://inspace.io)**

# INSPullToRefresh

`INSPullToRefresh` is a simple to use very generic pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling functionalities as a UIScrollView category.

There are a lot of of pull to refresh views. We've never found one we are happy with. We always end up customizing one, so we decided to write one that's highly generic. You can just write you view and it to the content of pull to refresh or infinite scroll container view.

We wrote couple samples that can be found in popular apps like Facebook, Vine, Twitter etc.

# Known Issue

`automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets` property on UIViewController which is by default to YES is breaking a lot of stuff, so it will be automatically turned off when adding pull to refresh and managed by library manually.

# Usage
```objective-c
[self.tableView ins_addPullToRefreshWithHeight:60.0 handler:^(UIScrollView *scrollView) {
    int64_t delayInSeconds = 1;
    dispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, delayInSeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC);
    dispatch_after(popTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){
        [scrollView ins_endPullToRefresh];

    });
}];

CGRect defaultFrame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 24, 24);

UIView <INSPullToRefreshBackgroundViewDelegate> *pullToRefresh = [[INSDefaultPullToRefresh alloc] initWithFrame:defaultFrame backImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"circleLight"] frontImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"circleDark"]];

self.tableView.ins_pullToRefreshBackgroundView.delegate = pullToRefresh;
[self.tableView.ins_pullToRefreshBackgroundView addSubview:pullToRefresh];
```

All you need to do is handle two INSPullToRefreshBackgroundViewDelegate methods in your custom view.

```objective-c
@protocol INSPullToRefreshBackgroundViewDelegate <NSObject>
@optional
- (void)pullToRefreshBackgroundView:(INSPullToRefreshBackgroundView *)pullToRefreshBackgroundView didChangeState:(INSPullToRefreshBackgroundViewState)state;

- (void)pullToRefreshBackgroundView:(INSPullToRefreshBackgroundView *)pullToRefreshBackgroundView didChangeTriggerStateProgress:(CGFloat)progress;

@end
```

## CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile` and run `$ pod install`.

``` ruby
pod 'INSPullToRefresh'
```

If you don't have CocoaPods installed, you can learn how to do so [here](http://cocoapods.org).

## ARC

`INSElectronicProgramGuideLayout` uses ARC.
