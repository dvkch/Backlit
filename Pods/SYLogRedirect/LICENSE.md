I do not really know licenses, so I won't give one precisely. I will just specify some rules I think fair:

this code is free to use for both free and commercial use.
you can modify it, fork it and redistribute it as you wish as long as I am somewhere in the thanks or licenses of the final program and the new code.
I hope you'll enjoy it,
