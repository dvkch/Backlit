/**
 * A "proxy" connection is a trade-off in terms of the ACID guarantees of the database.
 * 
 * Under normal operations, you must execute a read-write transaction in order to modify the datatbase.
 * If the transaction completes, then all data from the transaction has been written to the database.
 * And further, the transaction is durable even in the event of an application or system crash.
 * In other words, you're guaranteed the data will be there when the app re-launches.
 *
 * A proxy connection allows you to relax these constraints,
 * which may be useful for certain subsets of your data.
 * 
 * Here's how it works:
 * - you write collection/key/value rows to a proxy connection instance
 * - the value(s) are immediately readable via the proxy connection instance
 * - the proxy will attempt to write the changes (in batches) at some point in the near future
 * 
 * Thus you can read & write values as if the proxy is an in-memory dictionary.
 * However, the proxy will transparently write the changes to the database (but without any guarantees).
 * 
 * ** When should I use a proxy ?
 * 
 * You can use a proxy when:
 * - it's not important that you manage an individual transaction
 * - it's not important if the values don't make it to disk
 *
 * Example #1 : A download manager
 * 
 *   Applications sometimes have download logic encapsulated in a "manager" class.
 *   The manager class typically handles things such as:
 *   - downloaing resources on demand
 *   - parsing the results
 *   - providing getter methods to fetch particular items
 *   - automatically checking expiration dates & refreshing items as needed
 *   - automatically deleting unused expired items
 * 
 *   You'll notice the manager class is the ONLY class that hanles reading/writing certain values in the database.
 *   And it doesn't matter if a value doesn't get written to disk, as it can simply be re-downloaed.
 * 
 * Example #2 : NSUserDefaults replacement
 *
 *   NSUserDefaults works similarly to a connection proxy.
 *   From the documentation for NSUserDefaults:
 *
 *   > The synchronize method, which is automatically invoked at periodic intervals,
 *   > keeps the in-memory cache in sync with a userâ€™s defaults database.
 *  
 *   So NSUserDefaults will "eventually" write changes to disk.
 *   Unless you invoke the synchronize method, which involves waiting for disk IO to complete.
 * 
 *   Thus a connection proxy can easily replace your NSUserDefaults system.
 *   It's worth pointing out that a proxy connection doesn't have the equivalent of a synchronize method because
 *   you don't need one. A connection proxy always begins an asyncReadWrite transaction once it becomes "dirty".
 * 
 *   In case you're wondering, "Why would I use YapDatabase over NSUserDefaults ?"
 *   
 *   1. NSUserDefaults is not encrypted. And you can easily encrypt a YapDatabase.
 *   2. NSUserDefaults writes ALL values to disk everytime because it uses a plist to store the values on disk.
 *      YapDatabase uses a database, so only changed values need to be re-written.
 *      Thus, YapDatabase has the potential to be faster and involve less disk IO.
 *   3. YapDatabase has a notification system that tells you exactly which key/value pairs were changed.
 *   4. YapDatabase makes it easier to sync your data using a wide variety of cloud services.
 * 
 * ** Caveats
 *
 * A connection proxy instance expects to "own" a subset of the database.
 * That is, it expects to be the only thing reading & writing a subset of rows in the database.
 * If you violate this, you may get unexpected results.
 * 
 * Example #1 :
 * 
 *   - You write a value using a proxy.
 *   - You then attempt to read that value using a regular database connection.
 *   - If the proxy hasn't written the value to disk yet,
 *     then the regualar database connection won't see the proper value.
 * 
 * Example #2 :
 *   
 *   - You write a value using the proxy.
 *   - You write a different value (for the same collection/key) using the regular database connection.
 *   - The proxy later performs a readWrite, and writes its value for the collection/key,
 *     overwriting the regular database connection.
