An easy to use Objective-C level API for swizzling class and instance methods, as well as swizzling instance methods on specific instances only.

##Documentation

#####For further examples see the `JGMethodSwizzlerTests` Xcode project.


JGMethodSwizzler can be used for three basic swizzling types: Swizzling a specific method for all instances of a class, swizzling class methods and swizzling instance methods of specific instances only.

JGMethodSwizzler is completely thread safe and can handle multiple swizzles. Instance-specific swizzling should however not be combined with global swizzling in the same method.



###Swizzling a class method:
Swizzling the method `+(int)[TestClass test:(int)]`
```objc
[TestClass swizzleClassMethod:@selector(test:) withReplacement:JGMethodReplacementProviderBlock {
	//return a replacement block
	return JGMethodReplacement(int, const Class *, int arg) {
		//get the original value
		int orig = JGOriginalImplementation(int, arg);
		//return the modified value
		return orig+2;
	};
}];
```

After this code is run, calling the method will return the modified value until the method is deswizzled.


###Swizzling an instance method across all instances of a class:
Swizzling the method `-(int)[TestClass test:(int)]`
```objc
[TestClass swizzleInstanceMethod:@selector(test:) withReplacement:JGMethodReplacementProviderBlock {
	//return a replacement block
	return JGMethodReplacement(int, TestClass *, int arg) {
		//get the original value
		int orig = JGOriginalImplementation(int, arg);
		//return the modified value
		return orig+2;
	};
}];
```

After this code is run, calling the method will return the modified value until the method is deswizzled.



###Swizzling an instance method for a specific instance:
Swizzling the `description` method on a specific `NSObject`instance:
```objc
NSObject *object = [NSObject new];

[object swizzleMethod:@selector(description) withReplacement:JGMethodReplacementProviderBlock {
	return JGMethodReplacement(NSString *, NSObject *) {
		NSString *orig = JGOriginalImplementation(NSString *);
            
		return [orig stringByAppendingString:@" Swizzled!!"];
	};
}];
```

After this code is run, calling the method will return the modified value until the method is deswizzled.


###Deswizzling

All swizzles can be removed once they've been applied.


`deswizzleAll()` removes all swizzles.


####Deswizzling global class and instance swizzles

`deswizzleGlobal()` removes all swizzles that have been applied as global swizzles (not instance specific).

`+deswizzleClassMethod:(SEL)` deswizzles a specific class method.

`+deswizzleInstanceMethod:(SEL)` deswizzles a specific instance method.

`+deswizzleAllClassMethods` deswizzles all swizzled class methods of this class.

`+deswizzleAllInstanceMethods` deswizzles all swizzled instance methods of this class.

`+deswizzleAllMethods` deswizzles all swizzled methods of this class.


####Deswizzling Instance specific swizzles

`deswizzleInstances()` removes all swizzles that have been applied as instance specific swizzles.

`-deswizzleMethod:(SEL)` deswizzles a specific instance method of this instance.

`-deswizzle` deswizzles all swizzled instance methods of this instance.


##Notes
`JGMethodSwizzler` works with both ARC and MRC/MRR.
