SYKit
=======

Some useful Swift extensions on UIKit and Foundation.

I used to maintain a list of all methods here but it was way too much time consuming, you'll have to take a lot at the code directly.

This is mainly usefull to me as I use it a lot in my personnal projects - meaning I will break it very often. I'd recommend using it as a base implementation for your own needs instead of importing the whole using Cocoapods.

Use it as you like in every project you want, redistribute as much as you want, preferably with mentions of my name when it applies and don't blame me if it breaks :)
