A simple yet customizable horizontal picker view.

Works on iOS 6, 7 and 8.

*__News__: Say Good-Bye to Bridging-Header! 
The Swift version is [here](https://github.com/Akkyie/AKPickerView-Swift).*

Installation
------------

Use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

    pod "AKPickerView"

â€¦or simply add AKPickerView.h/m into your project.

Usage
-----

*__Caveat__*: From version 2.0, `dataSource` separated from `delegate`. When you updated it, check new how to use below.

1. Instantiate and set `delegate` and `dataSource` as you know,
	```objc
	self.pickerView = [[AKPickerView alloc] initWithFrame:<#frame#>];
	self.pickerView.delegate = self;
	self.pickerView.dataSource = self;
	```
	
1. then specify the number of items using `AKPickerViewDataSource` methods,
	```objc
	- (NSUInteger)numberOfItemsInPickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView;
	```
1. and specify contents to be shown. You can use either texts or images:
	```objc
	- (NSString *)pickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView titleForItem:(NSInteger)item;
	// OR
	- (UIImage *)pickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView imageForItem:(NSInteger)item;
	```
    - Using both texts and images are currently not supported. When you implement both, `-pickerView:titleForItem` will be called and the other won't. 
    - You currently cannot specify image sizes; AKPickerView shows the original image in its original size. Resize your images in advance if you need.

1. You can change its appearance with properties below.
	```objc
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIFont *font;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIFont *highlightedFont;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *textColor;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *highlightedTextColor;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat interitemSpacing;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat fisheyeFactor;
	```
    - All cells are laid out depending on the largest font, so large differnce between the sizes of *font* and *highlightedFont* is NOT recommended.  
    - fisheyeFactor property affects perspective distortion. The range is 0.0 - 1.0; slight value such as 0.0001 is recommended.

1. After all settings, **never forget to reload your picker**.
	```objc
	[self.pickerView reloadData];
	```
1. Optional: You can use `AKPickerViewDelegate` method to observe selection changes:
	
	```objc
	- (void)pickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView didSelectItem:(NSInteger)item;
	```
	Additionally, you can use `UIScrollViewDelegate` method to observe scrolling.
