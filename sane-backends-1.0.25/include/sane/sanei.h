/** @mainpage SANEI (SANE internal routines) documentation
 *
 * @image html sane-logo2.jpg
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The header files in the include/sane/ directory named sanei_*.h provide
 * function declarations and macros that can be used by every SANE backend.
 * Their implementations can be found in the sanei/ directory. The code aims
 * to be platform-independent to avoid lots of \#ifdef code in the backends.
 * Please use the SANEI functions wherever possible.
 *
 * This documentation was created by the use of doxygen, the 
 * doc/doxygen-sanei.conf configuration file and documentation in the sanei_*.h
 * files.
 *
 * This documentation is far from complete. Any help is appreciated.
 *
 * @section additional Additional documentation
 * - The SANE standard can be found at <a 
 *   href="http://www.sane-project.org/html/">the SANE webserver</a>,
 *   though the PostScript version produced from the source may be more recent.
 * - Information on how to write a backend: <a
 *   href="../backend-writing.txt">backend-writing.txt</a>.
 * - General SANE documentation is on <a
 *   href="http://www.sane-project.org/docs.html">the SANE documentation
 *   page</a>.
 * 
 * @section contact Contact 
 *
 * The common way to contact the developers of SANE is the sane-devel
 * mailing list. See the <a
 * href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">mailing list webpage</a>
 * for details. That's the place to ask questions, report bugs, or announce
 * a new backend.
