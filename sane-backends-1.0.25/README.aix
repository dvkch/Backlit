Under AIX, you'll need the generic SCSI device driver gsc written by
Matthew Jacob <mjacob@feral.com> (nice piece of work!). When you
install this driver, copy the header file gscdds.h to /usr/include, as
we look for it there. 
Find this driver under:

	ftp://ftp.feral.com/pub/aix/gsc.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE/pub/source/gsc.tar.gz

A version for AIX 4.3.3 and AIX 5.1 is also available.
