.SH NAME
sane\-dc210 \- SANE backend for Kodak DC210 Digital Camera
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sane\-dc210
library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that
provides access to the Kodak DC210 camera. THIS IS EXTREMELY ALPHA
CODE!  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
.SH "DEVICE NAMES"
The current version of the backend only allows one camera to be
connected.  The device name is always "0".
.SH CONFIGURATION
The contents of the
.I dc210.conf
specify the serial port and baud rate to use.  The baud rate 
specifies the maximum rate to use while downloading pictures.  (The
camera is always initialized using 9600 baud, then switches to the
higher rate).  On my 90MHz Pentium, I usually have no problems downloading
at 115200 baud as long as the system is not excessively busy and 
the "interrupt-unmask flag" is set in the IDE driver (hdparm \-u1).
Supported baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.
.PP
The dumpinquiry line causes some information about the camera to 
be printed.
.PP
cmdrespause specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of a) between
writing the command and reading the result should be used. 125000
seems to be the lowest I could go reliably.
.PP
breakpause is the time in 1,000,000ths of a usec between sending the
"back to default" break sending commands.      
.PP
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

.SH FILES
.TP
.I @CONFIGDIR@/dc210.conf
The backend configuration file (see also description of
.B SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).
.TP
.I @LIBDIR@/libsane\-dc210.a
The static library implementing this backend.
.TP
.I @LIBDIR@/libsane\-dc210.so
The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SANE_CONFIG_DIR
This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file
is searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in @CONFIGDIR@.  If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories.  For example, setting
.B SANE_CONFIG_DIR
to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories "tmp/config", ".", and
"@CONFIGDIR@" being searched (in this order).
.TP
.B SANE_DEBUG_DC210
If the library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. 
A value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller
levels reduce verbosity.

.PP
This backend is based somewhat on the dc25 backend included in this
package by Peter Fales.
.PP
The manpage was copied from the dc25 backend and somewhat edited by
Henning Meier-Geinitz.
