.SH NAME
sane \- Scanner Access Now Easy: API for accessing scanners

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B SANE
is an application programming interface (API) that provides standardized
access to any raster image scanner hardware. The standardized interface makes
it possible to write just one driver for each scanner device instead of one
driver for each scanner and application.

While
.B SANE
is primarily targeted at a UNIX environment, the standard has been carefully
designed to make it possible to implement the API on virtually any hardware or
operating system.
.PP
This manual page provides a summary of the information available about
.BR SANE .
.PP
If you have trouble getting your scanner detected, read the PROBLEMS section.

.SH TERMINOLOGY

An application that uses the 
.B SANE
interface is called a 
.B SANE frontend.
A driver that implements the 
.B SANE
interface is called a
.B SANE backend.
A 
.B meta backend
provides some means to manage one or more other backends.


.SH "SOFTWARE PACKAGES"
The package 
.RB ` sane\-backends '
contains a lot of backends, documentation (including the 
.B SANE
standard), networking support, and the command line frontend 
.RB ` scanimage '.
The frontends 
.RB ` xscanimage "', `" xcam "', and `" scanadf '
are included in the package
.RB ` sane\-frontends '. 
Both packages can be downloaded from the
.B SANE
homepage 
.RI ( http://www.sane\-project.org/ ).
Information about other frontends and backends can also be found on the
.B SANE
homepage.

.SH "GENERAL INFORMATION"
The following sections provide short descriptions and links to more
information about several aspects of
.B SANE.
A name with a number in parenthesis (e.g. 
.RB ` sane\-dll (5)')
points to a manual page. In this case 
.RB ` "man 5 sane\-dll" '
will display the page. Entries like
.RI ` @DOCDIR@/sane.tex '
are references to text files that were copied to the
.B SANE
documentation directory 
.RI ( @DOCDIR@/ )
during installation. Everything else is a URL to a resource on the web.

.TP
.B SANE device lists
The 
.B SANE
device lists contain information about the status of 
.B SANE
support for a specific device. If your scanner is not listed there (either
supported or unsupported), please contact us. See section HOW CAN YOU HELP
SANE for details. There are lists for specific releases of SANE, for the
current development version and a search engine:
.IR http://www.sane\-project.org/sane\-supported\-devices.html .
The lists are also installed on your system at @DOCDIR@/.
.TP
.B SANE mailing list
There is a mailing list for the purpose of discussing the SANE standard and its
implementations: sane\-devel.  Despite its name, the list is not only intended
for developers, but also for users. There are also some more lists for special
topics, however, for users, sane\-devel is the right list. How to subscribe and
unsubscribe:

.TP
.B SANE IRC channel
The IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel #sane can be found on the Freenode
network (irc.freenode.net). It's for discussing 
.B SANE
problems, talking about development and general 
.B SANE
related chatting. Before asking for help, please read the other documentation
mentioned in this manual page. The channel's topic is also used for
announcements of problems with SANE infrastructure (mailing lists, web server,
etc.).

.SH "DEVELOPER'S DOCUMENTATION"
It's not hard to write a
.B SANE
backend. It can take some time, however. You should have basic knowledge of C
and enough patience to work through the documentation and find out how your
scanner works. Appended is a list of some documents that help to write backends
and frontends. 
.PP 
The
.B SANE
standard defines the application programming interface (API) that is used to
communicate between frontends and backends. It can be found at
.I @DOCDIR@/sane.ps
(if latex is installed on your system) and on the
.B SANE
website:
.I http://www.sane\-project.org/html/
(HTML), or
.I http://www.sane\-project.org/sane.ps
(Postscript).
.PP
There is some more information for programmers in
.IR @DOCDIR@/backend\-writing.txt .
Most of the internal
.B SANE
routines
.RB ( sanei )
are documented using doxygen:
.IR http://www.sane\-project.org/sanei/ .
Before a new backend or frontend project is started, have a look at
.I @DOCDIR@/PROJECTS
for projects that are planned or not yet included into the
.B SANE
distribution and at our bug-tracking system:
.IR http://www.http://www.sane\-project.org/bugs.html .

.SH "PROBLEMS"
If your device isn't found but you know that it is supported, make
sure that it is detected by your operating system. For SCSI and USB scanners,
use the
.B sane\-find\-scanner
tool (see
.BR sane\-find\-scanner (1)
for details). It prints one line for each scanner it has detected and some
comments (#). If
.B sane\-find\-scanner
finds your scanner only as root but not as normal user, the permissions for
the device files are not adjusted correctly. If the scanner isn't found at all,
the operating system hasn't detected it and may need some help. Depending on
the type of your scanner, read
.BR sane\-usb (5)
or
.BR sane\-scsi (5).
If your scanner (or other device) is not connected over the SCSI bus or USB,
read the backend's manual page for details on how to set it up.
.PP

Now your scanner is detected by the operating system but not by 
.BR SANE ?
Try 
.BR "scanimage \-L" .
If the scanner is not found, check that the backend's name is mentioned in
.IR @CONFIGDIR@/dll.conf .
Some backends are commented out by default. Remove the comment sign for your
backend in this case. Also some backends aren't compiled at all if one of their
prerequisites are missing. Examples include dc210, dc240, canon_pp, hpsj5s,
gphoto2, pint, qcam, v4l, net, sm3600, snapscan, pnm. If you need one of these
backends and they aren't available, read the build instructions in the 
.B README
file and the individual manual pages of the backends.
.PP

Another reason for not being detected by
.B scanimage \-L
may be a missing or wrong configuration in the backend's configuration
file. While
.B SANE
tries to automatically find most scanners, some can't be setup correctly
without the intervention of the administrator. Also on some operating systems
auto-detection may not work. Check the backend's manual page for details.
.PP
If your scanner is still not found, try
setting the various environment variables that are available to assist in
debugging.  The environment variables are documented in the
relevant manual pages.  For example, to get the maximum amount of debug
information when testing a Mustek SCSI scanner, set environment variables
.BR SANE_DEBUG_DLL ", " SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK ", and " SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI
to 128 and then invoke 
.B scanimage
.B \-L .
The debug messages for the dll backend tell if the mustek backend was found
and loaded at all. The mustek messages explain what the mustek backend is
doing while the SCSI debugging shows the low level handling. If you can't find
out what's going on by checking the messages carefully, contact the sane\-devel
mailing list for help (see REPORTING BUGS below).
.PP
Now that your scanner is found by
.BR "scanimage \-L" ,
try to do a scan:
.BR "scanimage >image.pnm" .
This command starts a scan for the default scanner with default settings. All
the available options are listed by running
.BR "scanimage \-\-help" .
If scanning aborts with an error message, turn on debugging as mentioned
above. Maybe the configuration file needs some tuning, e.g. to setup the path
to a firmware that is needed by some scanners. See the backend's manual page
for details. If you can't find out what's wrong, contact sane\-devel.
.PP
To check that the
.B SANE
libraries are installed correctly you can use the test backend, even if you
don't have a scanner or other
.B SANE
device:
.IP
.B scanimage \-d
.I test
.B \-T
.PP
You should get a list of PASSed tests. You can do the same with your backend
by changing "test" to your backend's name.
.PP
So now scanning with
.B scanimage
works and you want to use one of the graphical frontends like
.BR xsane ,
.BR xscanimage ", or"
.B quiteinsane
but those frontends don't detect your scanner? One reason may be that you
installed two versions of 
.BR SANE .
E.g. the version that was installed by your distribution in 
.I /usr
and one you installed from source in 
.IR /usr/local/ .
Make sure that only one version is installed. Another possible reason is, that
your system's dynamic loader can't find the
.B SANE
libraries. For Linux, make sure that
.I /etc/ld.so.conf
contains
.I /usr/local/lib
and does
.B not
contain
.IR /usr/local/lib/sane .

.SH AUTHOR
David Mosberger-Tang and many many more (see
.I @DOCDIR@/AUTHORS
for details).  This man page was written by Henning Meier-Geinitz. Quite a lot
of text was taken from the
.B SANE
standard, several man pages, and README files.
