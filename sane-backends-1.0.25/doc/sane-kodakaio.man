.SH NAME
sane\-kodakaio \- SANE backend for Kodak aio printer / scanners

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B sane\-kodakaio
library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which
provides access to Kodak aio printer / scanners, like the ESP and Hero series.

This document describes backend version 2.4, which is the first candidate for
incorporation in sane-backends.

.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
This version should support models of the Kodak ESP and Hero series, and possibly some
Advent AiO scanners. The ESP 5250 and Hero 9.1 were used to develop the backend, 
but other models may work. Please see the desc file.

If you have a model not on that list, or reported as 'untested': the best way 
to determine level of support is to test the scanner directly.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file "kodakaio.conf" is used to tell the backend how to look
for scanners, and provide options controlling the operation of the backend.
This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend for a list 
of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The backend uses a single environment variable, SANE_DEBUG_KODAKAIO, which
enables debugging output to stderr. 

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
Most hardware options are either not supported or not exposed for control by 
the user, including: multifeed detection, image compression etc.
