;
; SANE Backend specification file
;
; It's basically emacs-lisp --- so ";" indicates comment to end of line.
; All syntactic elements are keyword tokens, followed by a string or
;  keyword argument, as specified.
;
; ":backend" *must* be specified.
; All other information is optional (but what good is the file without it?).
;
; See doc/descriptions.txt for details.

:comment "External backend made by canon. As this software contains non-free parts, it can't be included into SANE. If you can't find your model here, please have a look at the canon website which contains the latest list." 
:comment "Note: these backend are designed by Canon and are part of their proprietary scanning software. They may not work at all with SANE, or with SANE frontends."
