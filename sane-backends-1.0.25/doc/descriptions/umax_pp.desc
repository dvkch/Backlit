; SANE Backend specification file

; It's basically emacs-lisp --- so ";" indicates comment to end of line.
; All syntactic elements are keyword tokens, followed by a string or
;  keyword argument, as specified.
;
; ":backend" *must* be specified.
; All other information is optional (but what good is the file without it?).
