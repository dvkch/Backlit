SANE test suite
===============
Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@td.org.uit.no>

This is a test framework for the Scanner Access Now Easy project
(SANE).  Please add more tests.  This framework should be able to test
everything without installing, to make sure a new distribution is
function properly before the old one is replaced.  If it isn't, please
fix the bug. :-)

The current tests use the test backend to scan in flatbed, hand scanner and
three pass mode. Also a 16 bit color image is created and compared to the
"right" one. This test should detect any little/big endian issues in scanimage.
