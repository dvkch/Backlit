# udev rules file for supported USB and SCSI devices
#
# For the list of supported USB devices see /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d/20-sane.hwdb
#
# The SCSI device support is very basic and includes only
# scanners that mark themselves as type "scanner" or
# SCSI-scanners from HP and other vendors that are entitled "processor"
# but are treated accordingly.
#
# If your SCSI scanner isn't listed below, you can add it to a new rules
# file under /etc/udev/rules.d/.
#
# If your scanner is supported by some external backend (brother, epkowa,
# hpaio, etc) please ask the author of the backend to provide proper
# device detection support for your OS
#
# If the scanner is supported by sane-backends, please mail the entry to
# the sane-devel mailing list (sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org).
