README for the USB hotplug scripts for sane-backends :
------------------------------------------------------

If you intend to use a USB scanner with libusb and older versions of Linux, you
should install the hotplug package, and then take the following steps. For
current Linux kernels, "udev" is state of the art, see the "udev" directory
instead.

  o Copy the libsane.usermap and libusbscanner files from this directory to
    /etc/hotplug/usb/
  o If you use Linux 2.6.3 or older, add scanner to /etc/hotplug/blacklist so
    that the scanner.o kernel driver won't be loaded by hotplug. With later
    kernel versions there is no scanner module and therefore it's not necessary
    to use the blacklist.
  o Check if /etc/hotplug/usb/libsane.usermap already knows about your scanner.
    If your scanner is not in this list,add a line similar to the other ones
    using the vendor ID and the product ID of your scanner. Please contact the
    sane-devel mailing list in this case so the ids of your scanner can be added.
  o Make sure that the "scanner" group exists on your system and that every user
    who should be allowed to acces the scanner is a member of that group.
    Alternatively, you can enable access for every user of your system in
    libusbscanner.

The vendor ID and product ID of your scanner can be obtained by running
sane-find-scanner (you might need to run it as root).

Please note that the scanner.o (or scanner.ko in Linux 2.6) kernel module is
now deprecated and marked as obsolete in Linux 2.6. It is recommended to switch
to libusb.

If the hotplug support doesn't work for you once you have taken the steps
described above, check that your kernel has been built with hotplug support.
Otherwise, you'll need to rebuild your kernel.
