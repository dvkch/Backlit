# the following options are local to this scanner
# gain for red channel, if not given, will be automatically computed
# must be between 0 and 15
#option red-gain 8

# gain for green channel, if not given, will be automatically computed
# must be between 0 and 15
#option green-gain 4

# gain for blue channel, if not given, will be automatically computed
# must be between 0 and 15
#option blue-gain 8

# offset for red channel, if not given, will default to 0
# must be between 0 and 15
#option red-offset 2

# offset for green channel, if not given, will default to 0
# must be between 0 and 15
#option green-offset 1

# offset for blue channel, if not given, will default to 0
# must be between 0 and 15

# model number
#
# valid values are 610, 1220, 1600 and 2000

# by default, no model, we rely on autodetection
# in case you have black or 'inverted' scans, 
# you may override detection by providing the

# specify the port your scanner is connected to. 
#
# the value 'auto' will make the backend find the correct value
# by itself, it will scan  ppdev, ppi device, then hardware address
# 'safe-auto' will do the same but won't do direct hardware access
# on linux systems, you may provide the device name of the ppdev character 
# device : /dev/parport0, /dev/parport1, ......
#
# on *BSD, you may provide the device name of the ppi device: /dev/ppi0,
# /dev/ppi1, ...
#
# Possible hardware addresses are 0x378 (lp0)
# 0x278 (lp2) and 0x3c8 (lp1)
