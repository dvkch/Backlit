# coolscan3.conf: sample configuration file for coolscan3 backend
#
# The following entrie checks for your scanner by manufacturer (SCSI)
# and by vendor and product ID (USB). This is what the backend does when
# no configuration file can be found.
#
auto

# You can also configure the backend for specific device files, but this
# should not normally be necessary (under Linux at least).
# Syntax for specific devices: <interface>:<device>
#
# For a SCSI scanner, uncomment and edit the following line:
#scsi:/dev/scanner
#
# For a USB scanner, uncomment and edit the following line:
#usb:/dev/usbscanner
#
# For an IEEE 1394 scanner, use the SBP2 protocol (under Linux, use the
# sbp2 kernel module), and your scanner will be handled as a SCSI device.
