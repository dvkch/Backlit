# The following options are for testing and bug-hunting.  If your scanner
# needs one of these options to function reliably, please let me know.

# Maximum amount of data to read in a single SCSI command.  If not set
# (or set to 0), the backend will read as much data as allowed by the
# scanner model or the OS.  WARNING: Using this option overrides the
# hardcoded # maxread limits for all scanner models!  With more than
# 65536 bytes, my ST400 locks up (itself, the SCSI bus, the sg driver,
# and the machine). Use with caution.
#option maxread 65536

# Use this to switch the scanner lights on with a separate MODE SELECT call
# and wait for some time before starting to scan (to allow the lights to go
# to full intensity).  The time is in 1/10 seconds (i.e. 20 means 2 seconds).
# If not set, scanning starts immediately (works with my ST400).
#option delay 20

# The following are hacks that affect all scanners of the same model as the
# last attached device.  Used like this (assume ST800's had 8bit depth and
# 4MB internal buffer):
#   scsi SIEMENS "ST 400" Scanner * * 3 *
#   option scanner_bufsize 2097152
#   option scanner_bits 6
#   scsi SIEMENS "ST 800" Scanner * * 3 *
#   option scanner_bufsize 4194304
#   option scanner_bits 8
# Currently, the backend has entries for ST400, ST800 and "everything else".
# To add more scanners, you have to add a line in the st400_models array.
# Please note that these options are only for testing unknown devices with
# this backend.

# Internal scanner buffer:
#option scanner_bufsize 2097152

# Bit depth:
#option scanner_bits 6

# Maximum bytes to read in a single SCSI command (see also maxread above).
#option scanner_maxread 65536

# Supported resolutions (upto 15 different values).  If you specify an
# illegal value here, most likely the scanner will not report an error,
# but only scan a small sub-area of the requested area (at least my ST400
# does this).
#option scanner_resolutions 200 300 400

# This option causes the SCSI inquiry response to be written to
# "$HOME/st400.dump" (as binary data).  For debugging purposes.
#option dump_inquiry
