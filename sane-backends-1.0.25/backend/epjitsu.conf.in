# These devices require a firmware file in order to function, which must be
# extracted from the Fujitsu Windows driver. Presumably the Mac versions
# contain the firmware as well, but the author has no access such a machine.

# Firmware is installed in several different locations by the fujitsu software, 
# using the windows 'search' feature to look for '*.nal' is the easiest way to
# find them. They should be ~65K, and have the scanner's name as part of the
# file name. They are often inside a .cab file.

# To extract .nal files from cabinet files on Linux, use the following steps:
# (you need the "unshield" tool, which is - in Debian - in the unshield package)
#
#  1) Mount the ScanSnap installation DVD
#     (mount point e.g. /media/dvd)
#
#  2) Extract the .nal files c$ from the cabinet files on the DVD
#     using the following shell script:
#
#	# loop over all cabinet files found on the DVD
#	for cab in $(find /media/dvd/ -name \*.cab); do
#	    # search for .nal files in the cabinet files
#	    nalinfo=$(unshield l $cab | grep '\.nal$')
#
#	    # we found something
#	    if [ -n "$nalinfo" ]; then
#	        #echo -e "=== $cab ===\n$nalinfo"
#
#	        # loop over all fields in $nalinfo
#	        for nal in $nalinfo; do
#	            # if the element of $nalinfo is a .nal file name
#	            if echo "$nal" | grep -q '\.nal$' - 2>/dev/null; then
#	                # extract .nal file form the cabinet file
#	                unshield x "$cab" "${nal##*\\}"
#	            fi
#	        done
#	    fi
#	done

# Copy the file someplace sane can reach it. Then update the line below.
