# For scanner(s) not detected by the default UDP broadcast method (eg: perhaps it
# is not on your local network) then you can add one or more "named_scanner" entries
# explicitly giving the hostname/IP address.  Uncomment one of the following and
# modify the hostname appropriately:
#
#named_scanner: printer
#named_scanner: 192.168.0.20
#named_scanner: myscanner.somewhere.else.org
