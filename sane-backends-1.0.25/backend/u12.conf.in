# U12-SANE Backend configuration file
#

# each device needs at least two lines:
# - [usb] vendor-ID and product-ID
# - device devicename
# i.e. for Plustek (0x07B3) U1212 (0x0001)
# [usb] 0x07B3 0x0001
# device /dev/usbscanner
# or
# device libusb:bbb:ddd
# where bbb is the busnumber and ddd the device number
# make sure that your user has access to /proc/bus/usb/bbb/ddd
#
# additionally you can specify some options
# warmup, lOffOnEnd, lampOff
#
# For autodetection use
# [usb]
# device /dev/usbscanner
#
# or simply
# [usb]
#
# or if you want a specific device but you have no idea about the
# device node or you use libusb, simply set vendor- and product-ID
# [usb] 0x07B3 0x0001
# device auto
#
# NOTE: autodetection is safe, as it uses the info it got
#       from the USB subsystem. If you're not using the
#       autodetection, you MUST have attached that device
#       at your USB-port, that you have specified...
