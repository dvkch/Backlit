# The options are only meaningful if the backend was
# compiled with USE_FORK defined
#
# option buffersize: size of one buffer allocated as shared
#    memory for data transfer between the reader process
#    and the parent process
# option buffers: number of these buffers
#    The minimum is 2
# option readqueue: number of queued read requests. This is
#    with the current SANE version (1.01) only useful for
#    Linux, since queued read requests are not supported
#    for other operating systems. 
#
#    For Linux, a value of 2 is recommended, at least if a
#    JX-250 is used. Bigger values are only a waste of memory.
#
#    For other operationg systems, set this value to zero
#
# option stop_on_fsu_error: should be 0 or 1. If set to 0,
#    the "FSU light dispersion error" does not cause the abortion
#    of a scan.
#
# option default_scan_source: valid values are "auto", "fsu", "adf"
#    and "flatbed". For "auto", the backend will enable an ADF or
#    or FSU, if installed. 
#
