### magicolor.conf
###
### here are some examples for how to configure the Magicolor backend

### Timeout settings: SNMP autodetection, Scan data read requests and other
###                   read requests. All values are given in milliseconds,
###                   i.e. 1000 is 1 second.

# SNMP auto-detection waits 1.5 seconds
snmp-timeout 1500

# wait 15 seconds for scan data (color scans take ~6 seconds to initialize,
# so we need to wait longer than that)
scan-data-timeout 15000

# Wait 5 seconds for all other data requests
request-timeout 5000


### Network: Format is "net IP_ADDRESS [USB_ID]" or "net autodiscovery"
###          if USB_ID is left out, SNMP is used to detect the device type

net autodiscovery
#net 10.0.0.5

### The following is a magicolor 1690mf with explicit IP-Address
#net 10.0.0.5 0x2098
# net 192.168.0.1

### USB: format is "usb" for automatic (libusb) discovery, based on USB IDs,
###      or "usb <vendor ID> <device ID> to force the use of a particular
###      device (the backend has some additional checks and will not use
###      non-KONICA MINOLTA devices, though)

usb

### For libusb support for unknown scanners use the following command
### usb <product ID> <device ID>
### e.g.:

# usb 0x132b 0x2098
