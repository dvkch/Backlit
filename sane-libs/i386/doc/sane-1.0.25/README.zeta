SANE and Zeta
-------------

The Zeta port is based on existing BeOS port, with some changes 
to accomodate yellowTAB's internal build procedure, and some new 
conventions brought up by Zeta.

Cf. README.beos for more historical stuff.

SANE 1.0.9 was updated for Zeta by Ithamar Adema for yellowTAB.

SANE 1.0.15 was updated for BeOS and Zeta by Fran√ßois Revol for yellowTAB.

Zeta uses a modified version of Philippe Houdoin's Sanity GUI frontend.
