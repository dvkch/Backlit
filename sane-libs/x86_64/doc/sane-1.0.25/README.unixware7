SANE on UnixWare 7 
================== 

The easiest way to get SANE working on a UnixWare 7.1.X system (UW 7.0.0 
and 7.0.1 are not supported) is to download and install the SANE binary 
distribution from SCOs Skunkware web site. The URL is: 

        ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw7/Packages 

Use the pkgadd command to install the files, e.g.: 

        # pkgadd -d `pwd`/sane-1.0.2.pkg 

A web page with further information specific to SANE on UnixWare 7 can be 
found here: 

        http://www.sco.com/skunkware/sane/index.html 

However, please note that the SANE package that is available from the 
Skunkware server will most likely contain the latest stable version of 
SANE. Since SANE is continously being worked on, you might want to download 
the latest source from the CVS repository and build the source yourself. 

To build SANE on a UnixWare 7.1.X system the following packages are required: 

        * make (GNU make) 
        * glibs (contains gtk, glib, libjpeg, libpnm, libtiff etc.; only
          necessary for frontends xscanimage, xcam, and xsane which are
          distributed separately) 

The packages can be downloaded from the Skunkware ftp server (see URL above). 
I've used the following versions to build sane-1.0.2: 

        * make-3.78.1.pkg 
        * glibs-2.0.3.pkg 

If you want to include support for The Gimp (this is optional), you need to 
install the gimp package, too. This is the version I've used: 

        * gimp-1.0.4.pkg 

GCC is not required. SANE compiles quite happily (and faster) with UnixWares 
native C compiler. 

Set the LD_RUN_PATH variable to add /usr/local/lib to the list of directories 
to be searched by the dynamic linker: 

        $ LD_RUN_PATH=/usr/local/lib 
        $ export LD_RUN_PATH 

Run the configure script as following: 

        $ LIBS="-lsdi" ./configure 

(The sdi library contains the SCSI passthrough functions the UW7 port of SANE 
uses to access the scanner from user space.) 

Run gmake to build SANE: 

        $ gmake 

SCSI access from user space requires special privileges. If you want users 
without root perms to be able to use the scanner you can use the filepriv 
command to change the privileges that are associated with the SANE 
applications: 

        # /sbin/filepriv -f driver -f sysops /usr/local/bin/scanimage 
        # /sbin/filepriv -f driver -f sysops /usr/local/bin/xscanimage 
        # /sbin/filepriv -f sysops /usr/local/bin/xcam 

If you have built SANE with support for The Gimp you might want to create 
a symlink from the plug-in directory to the xscanimage and xcam binaries, 
e.g.: 

        # ln -s /usr/local/bin/xscanimage \ 
                /usr/local/lib/gimp/1.0/plug-ins/xscanimage 
        # ln -s /usr/local/bin/xcam /usr/local/lib/gimp/1.0/plug-ins/xcam
